# Datastructures-BinarySearchTrees
This project pertains to the implementation of important methods related to binary search trees in the context of the Data Structures and Advanced Algorithms course within the Computer Engineering department. 

The methods in the project are as follows: Constructing a new BST object, Implementing the remove(int value) method, Using the remove(value) method, Implementing the findMin() method, Implementing the findMax() method, Using findMin() and findMax() methods, Implementing the printTreeInorder() method, and Using printTreeInorder() method.

1)A new BST was created using the given insert() usage and applied in the BST class to accumulate values (7, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6).

2)A remove(int value) method was implemented in the BST class for removing elements, where the BST was reorganized accordingly based on the value removed.

3)The removal (value) usage was employed to retrieve any selected item.

4)In the BST class, a findMin() method was implemented to locate and return the minimum value.

5)In the BST class, a findMax() method was implemented to locate and return the maximum value.

6)The findMin() and findMax() methods were used to find and print the minimum and maximum values.

7)The printTreeInorder() implementation was applied.

8)The printTreeInorder() usage was utilized to print the second BST object.
